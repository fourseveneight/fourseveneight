# FourSevenEight is a website for sharing news, primarily in the tech industry

1. It is meant to provide high quality, factual posts about technology, finance, and science
2. It is meant to be an open forum for discussing these subjects

## Usage of my code:

1. Feel free to take and use any of the code I've written here for your own purposes.
2. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, shoot me an email at anishsinha0128@gmail.com and I'll do my best to respond (:

## documentation:

1. As soon as I can, I will publish documentation of my API using Postman. When that happens, I'll update this readme.

### This project is meant to honor someone who used to be very close to me. She'd always tell me to breathe in for four, hold for seven, and out for eight. Wherever you are, this project is for you <3
